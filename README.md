## ðŸ§ª Solving Problems

Each problem lives in a subfolder like:

```bash
problems/question1/
â”œâ”€â”€ prompt.md            # Problem description
â”œâ”€â”€ expected_output.txt  # Hints or expected structure
â””â”€â”€ student_code.py      # This is what you edit
```

To test your solution locally:

```bash
pytest -k test_problem1
```

## ðŸ›  Example Ollama CLI Commands

- Pull a model:

  ```bash
  ollama pull qwen3:0.6b
  ```

- Run a prompt:

  ```bash
  ollama run qwen3:0.6b "What is the capital of Peru?"
